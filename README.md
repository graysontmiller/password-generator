# Password Generator

A password generation application made from JavaScript, with html and css.

# Description

This project was made for challenge #3 in the UNCC Web Development boot-camp. The goal of this application was to code a random password generator. I was supplied basic HTML and CSS files to make th application appear on the web as well as an empty JavaScript file where my code was placed.

  - Would you like numbers to be included in your password?
  - Would you like special characters to be included in your password?
- Copy the generated password for personal use.

# Final Thoughts

This challenge was very overwhelming to me in the beginning because I wasn't sure how to even begin approaching something like this. I had an "aha" moment when I realized that it was as simple as creating a function to take user inputs and equate them into potential variables for the password generation. The most challenging aspect of it from there was figuring out proper syntax and such which will just come to me over time. I feel like this was a fairly easy project that did a good job of reinforcing the idea of creating my own functions to perform whatever actions I want.
